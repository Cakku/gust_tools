    /* Seeds used by a game executable can be found in its IDA Freeware disassembly:
     * 1. Locate the function call that uses literal value 3B9A73C9h (SEED_CONSTANT).
     * 2. At the beginning of that function you get length[] and table[] array values (lengths are usually 1Dh, 13h, 0Bh).
     * 3. Find the first call to a function that uses parameters 800h and 100h and look for another literal. That's main[0].
     * 4. Find the next literal being used after this call. That's main[1].
     * 5. Go further down and look for 2 literals, one of which is half the value of the first and is prime. That's fence.
     * 6. Finally look for a call near the end where 80h is used as parameter. The other literal there is main[2].
     * Note: All of the seeds are prime numbers so if you have a number that is not prime, then it's not a seed.
     * If needed, you can access deobfuscated binary code (to use with IDA) by saving the WinDbg dump.
